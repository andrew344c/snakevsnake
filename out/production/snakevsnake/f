The lessons lean towards a slower pace, which I believe is the correct choice, as it allows beginners to effectively learn and reduces struggling members, but the way lessons are conducted could be improved. Most of our lessons in the club this year resulted in just club members copying whatever the instructor was coding on the screen, and pasting it on their own local workspace without knowing what the code actually does. A more effective way of teaching projects I would help implement as an officer would be to rather teach members the raw knowledge and skills of mobile development and utilizing these skills they would build up an app. Obviously, projects will start small, such as the timer app we did in the beginning of the club meetings, and gradually escalate to larger and more challenging projects. And although our meetings this year only referenced web app development, I believe that introducing hybrid app technologies, such as React Native and Flutter (both in which I have experience in), can be beneficial to members, since they are still much more efficient than web apps and are also currently rapidly growing in popularity. The same can also be applied to native app development, but teaching iOS native app development will be challenging, as XCode is basically required since it provides many of the essential tools needed to build a swift project, and obviously, it can't be expected that everyone is running macos.
